## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JTimmr/Stochastic_Simulation
   cd Stochastic_Simulation

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash

## Important Note

The parameter values provided in the Jupyter Notebook are optimized for GPU programming. If you are running the code on a CPU, be aware that the computation may take a significantly longer time. Consider adjusting the parameters based on your hardware specifications for optimal performance. If CUDA is installed and a GPU is detected, the major part of the code will automatically be executed on the GPU.
